Battleships game

The program creates a 10x10 grid and places at ranom a number of ships:

1x Aircraft Carrier (5 squares)
1x Battleship (4 squares)
2x Patrol Boats (2 squares)

The ships can touch but they do not overlap

The application accepts input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to target, 
and feedback to the user whether the shot was a success, miss, and additionally report on the sinking of any vessels.
